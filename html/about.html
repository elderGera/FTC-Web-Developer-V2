                Welcome to our Front-End Web Developer Traineeship Program -
                your gateway to a rewarding career in web development. This year
                long program has been meticulously designed to equip you with
                the essential skills and knowledge required to excel in the

              </p>
              <p>
                Our comprehensive curriculum covers everything from the
                fundamentals of XHTML/HTML5 and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to
                more advanced concepts like Responsive Web Design (RWD), Content
                Management Systems (CMS), JavaScript, jQuery, and React. You'll
                learn how to transform design mock-ups into modern, clean, and
                responsive web interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout the traineeship, you'll gain hands-on experience in
                project management, working with deadlines, and collaborating on
                projects, ensuring you're prepared for real-world challenges.
                Plus, you'll have the opportunity to create your very own online
                portfolio, showcasing your skills and accomplishments to
                potential employers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our entry requirements are designed to welcome passionate
                individuals who are eager to build websites and make a mark in
                the web development industry. You'll need a Leaving Certificate
                Standard or equivalent, or progression from a relevant related
                course, along with a flair for troubleshooting, a keen desire to
                work in this sector, and the ability to work both independently
                and as part of a team.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon completing the traineeship, you'll be awarded a QQI Minor
